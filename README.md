# Coding Challenge 18: NoSQL

## Description

This is a NoSQl coding challenge with UCF WebDev Bootcamp. The challenge required that we made a backend with MongDb(Mongoose) and api routes with Express.js. A user will be able to add a "thought" under their username. Other users can react to those thoughts with a 'reaction'. A user can also require friends and become other user friends. All components of the documents: users, reactions, and friends, can also be deleted and updated.

## Dependencies

* [Express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express)
* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
* [Mongoose](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose)

## Usage 

The application need to be cloned in order to run. Below our videos testing the routes with [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/products/insomnia).
